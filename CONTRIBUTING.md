# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the `pylangacq` codebase!

This page assumes that you have already created a fork of the `pylangacq` repo
under your GitHub account and have the codebase available locally for
development work. If you have followed
[these steps](https://github.com/jacksonllee/pylangacq#development),
then you are all set.

## Working on a Feature or Bug Fix

The development steps below assumes that your local Git repo has a remote
`upstream` link to `jacksonllee/pylangacq`:
   
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jacksonllee/pylangacq.git
```

After this step (which you only have to do once),
running `git remote -v` should show your local Git repo
has links to both "origin" (pointing to your fork `<your-github-username>/pylangacq`)
and "upstream" (pointing to `jacksonllee/pylangacq`).

To work on a feature or bug fix, here are the development steps: 

1. Before doing any work, check out the master branch and
   make sure that your local master branch is up-to-date with upstream master:
   
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ``` 
   
2. Create a new branch. This branch is where you will make commits of your work.
   (As best practice, never make commits while on a master branch.
   Running `git branch` tells you which branch you are on.)
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b new-branch-name
   ```
   
3. Make as many commits as needed for your work.

4. When you feel your work is ready for a pull request,
   push your branch to your fork.

   ```bash
   git push origin new-branch-name
   ```
   
5. Go to your fork `https://github.com/<your-github-username>/pylangacq` and
   create a pull request off of your branch against the `jacksonllee/pylangacq` repo.

## Running Tests

The `pylangacq` repo has continuous integration (CI) turned on,
with autobuilds running pytest and flake8 for the test suite
(in the [`pylangacq/tests/`](pylangacq/tests) directory)
and code style checks, respectively.
If an autobuild at a pending pull request fails because of pytest or flake8
errors, then the errors must be fixed by further commits pushed to the branch
by the author.

If you would like to help avoid wasting free Internet resources
(every push triggers new CI autobuilds),
you can run pytest and flake8 checks locally before pushing commits:

```bash
flake8 setup.py pylangacq
pytest -vv --cov=pylangacq pylangacq
```
