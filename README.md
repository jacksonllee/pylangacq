PyLangAcq is a Python library for language acquisition research.
It allows flexible handling of the CHILDES data.

Full documentation: http://pylangacq.org/

## Features

- Comprehensive capabilities of handling CHAT transcripts as used in CHILDES
- Intuitive data structures for flexible data access and all sorts of modeling work
- Standard developmental measures such as TTR, MLU, and IPSyn readily available
- More benefits from Python: fast coding, numerous libraries
  for computational modeling and machine learning
- Powerful extensions for research with conversational data in general

## Download and install

PyLangAcq is available via `pip`:

```bash
pip install -U pylangacq
```

PyLangAcq works with Python 3.6 or above.

## Development

The source code of PyLangAcq is hosted on GitHub at
https://github.com/jacksonllee/pylangacq,
where development also happens.

For the latest changes not yet released through `pip` or working on the codebase
yourself, you may obtain the latest source code through GitHub and `git`:

1. Create a fork of the `pylangacq` repo under your GitHub account.
2. Locally, make sure you are in some sort of a virtual environment
   (venv, virtualenv, conda, etc).
3. Download and install the library in the "editable" mode
   together with the core and dev dependencies within the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/pylangacq.git
    cd pylangacq
    pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e .
    ```

We keep track of notable changes in
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/jacksonllee/pylangacq/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
