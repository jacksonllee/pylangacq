PyLangAcq: Language Acquisition Research in Python
==================================================

PyLangAcq is a Python library primarily for language acquisition research.
An important goal is allow very flexible and powerful handling of CHILDES data
in any custom programs for computational modeling.


Features
--------

* Comprehensive capabilities of handling CHAT transcripts
  as used in CHILDES
* Intuitive data structures for flexible data access and all sorts of modeling work
* Standard developmental measures such as TTR, MLU, and IPSyn readily available
* More benefits from Python: fast coding, numerous libraries for computational
  modeling and machine learning
* Powerful extensions for research with conversational data in general
